A simple Programm for Auction using Designpattern 
The used Design-Pattern are SingleTon and Observer Pattern
# How does it works?
In an auction, a bidder makes an offer to purchase an item or service by submitting a bid. <br>
The actioneer, also known as the auctioneer, is responsible for managing the auction and determining the validity of the bid.<br>
If the bid is higher than the previous bid, the actioneer will accept it and announce it to the other bidders.<br>
If the bid is not higher than the previous bid, it will be rejected. The auction continues until there are no more bids or a predetermined end time is reached. <br>
The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the auction and is expected to pay the bid amount for the item or service.<br>
<br>
